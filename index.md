# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**, advised by **Prof. Josep Torrellas**. My research interests lie at the intersection of **computer architecture, distributed systems**, and **machine learning**.

Prior to joining UIUC, I completed my **M.Sc. in Computer Science** at **EPFL** (Switzerland) and my **B.Sc. in Computer Science** and **B.Sc. in Mathematics** at **Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM)** (Spain). During my studies, I also spent a year as an exchange student at **University of California, San Diego (UCSD)**.

## Research Focus

I am passionate about designing efficient hardware-software systems for next-generation datacenters. My current work explores:
- Computer Architecture for Datacenters with Heterogeneous Accelerators
- Machine Learning
- Distributed Systems and Cloud Storage Systems
